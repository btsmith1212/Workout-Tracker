# Workout-Tracker

## Description

This is a workout tracker that uses Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API. The website uses Handlebars.js as the templating engine to render the display in real-time depending on user input and access rights. It uses MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database, and has both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Users can create new workout templates and assign them to a certain day throughout the week.

## Roadmap

Future functionality includes: deleting templates, displaying more than one workout type per day, condensing multiple days into one card.
